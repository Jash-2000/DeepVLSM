# DeepVLSM

The project involves implementation of 3-D and 2-D sliced segmentational VLSM using various modified and custom architectures. This would be compared to simple SVR-LSM techniques. This is project is proposed to be the first of such kind of work.

The current version contains the extraction, EDA and visualization of fMRI based lession data, in EDF data-fomrat. The entire analysis was done in python.

Will upload the main code soon...
